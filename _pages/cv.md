## Summary
I am a pragmatic, yet analytical data scientist. My working experience in data science, data engineering and entrepreneurship, combined with my educational background of industrial engineering and management science, give me great flexibility in the types of environments and roles in which I can work effectively.

## Employment History

**Freelance data scientist @ Vdb.ai** \
_April 2020 - present_ \
I currently work as a self-employed data science consultant, after winding down Maneros and Cubonacci over the past few years.

**Angel investor and partner @ Cubonacci** \
**(now part of Databricks)** \
_November 2018 - April 2021_ \
In 2018 I advised the founding team of Cubonacci and invested in the MLOps oriented startup. In April 2021 some of the founding team joined [databricks](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/07/02/a-shared-vision-for-data-teams-why-cubonacci-joined-databricks.html).

**Data scientist and partner @ Maneros** \
**(now part of Digital Power)** \
_May 2010 - April 2020_ \
I founded Maneros together with my two brothers, initially for e-learning activities, but later focusing on data science and engineering consultancy. In 2018 we sold a minority share to [Digital Power](https://digital-power.com/en), and in 2020 we [sold the remaining shares](https://digital-power.com/maneros).

**SAS consultant @ PW Consulting** \

Merging four different models that explained traveller behavior into one new model. I am currently the product owner of this team, empowering the team to really take ownership of the product, and at the same time providing guidance on the development direction. Tooling used is Python, Databricks and Azure.

**ROCKT2.0** \
Initial development and further iterations of a traveller behaviour model, made for NS Stations. I took on supervision of the project of translating a proof-of-concept model to a productionalized version. For future iterations of the model I worked with NS to investigate, develop and implement the changes. Final research here was a bespoke deep learning model for the traveller behavior, which formed a basis for Flux, the successor of ROCKT2.0.
