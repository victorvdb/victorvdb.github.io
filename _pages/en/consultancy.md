As a consultant I am pragmatic and analytical. Initiatives around 'data' and especially data science, tend to be too large or too hyped, without realistic expectations of what's possible, or buying from the organization. AI initiatives are started because one should start them, not to help the organization. I start with the business - what is your organization doing, and what matters? Oftentimes many improvements can be identified and implemented, without having to resort to AI techniques. These improvements can be as good or better than using AI.

The conditions for a succesfol AI project poses for the available data, required engineering, and organizational change are quite strict. The first two tend to draw more attention than the latter one, while organizational change is crucial in deploying any AI solution. I start with identifying what the goal is you want to reach, and design solutions that fit your demand. With my experience on the areas of data science, data management, data architecture, but also product ownership and as a interim workstream lead in a business transformation program, I can fill out the necessary roles, even if the demand for the roles shifts through time.
