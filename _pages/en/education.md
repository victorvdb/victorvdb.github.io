Since 2019 I am one of three lecturers for the master course [Data Science for Business](https://www.hu.nl/deeltijd-opleidingen/data-science-for-business) at the [Utrecht University of Applied Sciences](https://www.internatonalhu.com). This course, which is part of the [Master of Informatics](https://www.hu.nl/deeltijd-opleidingen/master-of-informatics-applied-data-science), emphasizes the effective deployment of data science within an organization, rather than focusing on the mathematical or engineering side of data science. There is attention for the functional perspective of algorithms, rather than the technical perspective. The target for the masterclass are part time students - people who work besides studying.

The masterclass consists of two parts - one part methods & techniques in which algorithms are taught and implemented using Excel. This allows the students to understand what an algorithm is, and how they work, without having to learn R or Python (which are taught in different masterclasses). Many of the students are interested in what data science is, how to apply it within a business context, but not interested in learning how to program. The second part of the masterclass - data science in practice - has the students work through a case from their own organization, using [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) as guidance.

I am also available for developing in-house courses related to data science.
