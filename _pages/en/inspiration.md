Inspirationsessions are where I really get my energy from. I show the possibilities and impossibilities of data science in current times, using examples from my own experience and from relatable public data science initiatives. Furthermore I look to interact with the audience, which turns the sessions from solely educational, to also entertaining. The goal is that everyone leaves knowing something new, with a smile, and inspired to think of data science initiatives in their work. These sessions are of course tailored to the audience - I will happily get in touch with you first to scope the sessions. Reach out to me (victor at vdb.ai) for more information!
