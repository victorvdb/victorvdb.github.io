## In summary

I have a curious and pragmatic mindset. By focussing on what really matters to the business, I add value quickly, but also care for longer term perspectives and embedding solutions within the organisation.

`2021-2022`
__Interim product owner advanced analytics__ at [_Nederlandse Spoorwegen_](https://www.ns.nl/en)
As a product owner of a newly formed team, I was responsible for the re-development of a traveller model. Four legacy models existed, with conflicting requirements and results, which needed to be merged into one model, in the Azure cloud using Databricks.

`2020-2021`
__Information architect__ at [_Nederlandse Spoorwegen_](https://www.ns.nl/en)
For the department ComIT (Commerce + IT) I have analysed and mapped the required data and information architecture for several projects. Many of them were related to a legacy-to-cloud migration.

`2019-2021`
__Data science engineer__ at [_Nederlandse Spoorwegen_](https://www.ns.nl/en)
For NS Stations I improved an existing traveller model, by developing a bespoke machine learning architecture that could optimize several necessary parameters. The results formed the basis for the model that would be developed in the Azure cloud (see Interim PO @ NS)

`2019-2020`
__Data architect__ at [_RNW Media_](https://www.rnw.org)
For RNW Media (a non-profit) I was responsible for developing a data architecture, and to develop support for implementing it when necessary. The end result - a data architecture on GCP using Apache Airflow was later developed and implemented.

`2014`
__Workstream lead business intelligence and datawarehousing__ at [_Office Depot Europe_](https://www.officedepot.eu)
During a lean six sigma transformation project, I took up the rol of workstream lead BI & DWH, with the resposibility to deliver an organizational structure and identify architectural changes needed.

`2012-2014`
__Business intelligence architect__ at [_Office Depot Europe_](https://www.officedepot.eu)
Part of a program called World Class BI, I was responsible to define the SOLL architecture of the BI enviroment. The work on the IST situation was a shared responsibility, due to amount of work required. The program was superseded by a lean six sigma business transformation project.

`2011-2017`
__Data scientist__ at [_Nederlandse Spoorwegen_](https://www.ns.nl/en)
At the Dutch Railroads I delivered several projects, from initiation to delivery, with consultants from Maneros, together with employees from NS. These projects were surrounding traveller-flow, customer satisfaction, customer investment models, and queue modelling.

`2010-2012`
__SAS consultant__ at [_Office Depot Europe_](https://www.officedepot.eu)
As an independent contractor, I went from operationally supporting the mail selection department, to working out a proof of concept for a major improvement on the tooling they were using, to rolling out those improvements over Europe.

`2009-2010`
__SAS consultant__ at [_Nederlandse Spoorwegen_](https://www.ns.nl/en)
As a consultant for the Dutch Railroads, I worked on developing a custom tool to administer reference and master data for their datawarehouse, as well as develop the first iteration of the datawarehouse concerning the OV Chipkaart.

`2008-2009`
__SAS consultant__ at [_Belastingdienst_](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/individuals)
